This text is for asymmetric (multiple categories of riders) teams of WTRL TTTs. In a "normal" TTT you'd ideally match your riders capabilities and weights.

## How do I, as a rider, read those TTT power sheets?

First let's go through each column:

I guess the "**Name**" column is pretty self-explanatory. It contains the rider name.

Then you have columns "**P1 [W]**" all the way to "**P5+ [W]**". "P" stands for position, so each column is for position 1 to position 5+ (meaning 5 or further back) of the rider in a pace line. The unit "W" indicates that the numerical value in each field simply represents the amount of watts the rider needs to do **on flat terrain**.

However, we can distinguish between position 1 and all other positions. If you are in position 1, i.e. the front of the group/pace line, you really need to do those watts, otherwise your team loses speed and hence time. Especially in the beginning of the race you might be tempted to go harder, because it feels so easy. **Don't.** Seriously, it will harm your team more than you know, but this section is about reading the sheet, not tactics. So I'll come back to that later.

Next you have the columns "**P1 [W/kg]**" to "**P5+ [W/kg]**". These fields contain the power from "P1 [W]" to "P5+ [W]" relative to your weight, giving you equivalent W/kg for each position. These fields are informational only.

"**P1 [%]**" to "**P5+ [%]**" are the watts from "P1 [W]" to "P5+ [W]" relative to your FTP[^1]. This is somewhat important. First, your DS should make sure you have at most 85% of your FTP in P5+ to give adequate recovery after each of your pulls[^2]. Seconds, your DS should make sure you have at most 120% of your FTP in position 1[^3]. Third, check that if 100% roughly equals your FTP[^4].

[^1]: FTP in our case means.
[^2]: This is a generalization and individual riders might require more or less rest. It might also depend on how you are feeling on a particular day.
[^3]: This is also a generalization and individual riders might cope better or worse with those intervals.
[^4]: FTP here means not the power you were once able to achieve over a 20-minute period when three red-haired virgins danced around a well, braiding each other's hair. FTP means the power you can hold *today*, *now*, *for an hour*, or, alternatively, the power you can hold *today*, *now*, *for 20 minutes* and take 95% of that value.

## What does a rider do with that information

The sheet gives you the information you need to ride. First of all: yes, the order is important, or rather: the order given is (as far as I know at the time of this writing) the least disadvantegous. So use it.

* If you have a DS: check that everything is in order and you're done. Do the "No-DS" steps as backup (DS's internet might fail).
* If you don't have a DS: 
  -   Note your power numbers for position 1 to 3 on a post it
  -   Stick on/near your monitor or bicycle computer so you can read them while riding
  -   Ride those numbers!

## Why is that power so important?

Multiple reasons!

(1) Pace your ride (and your team). It tends to feel easy in the beginning, hence riders and teams tend to overdo it. Try negative splits.

(2) Overpace your weaker riders. Depending on the course it might be tactically a good idea to drop them at some point, but you need at least one lower category rider to make it to the finish line. Unfortunately that best lower cat rider will be the most exhausted if higher cat riders go over power.

(3) If riders approximately hold their power for each position on flat terrain, a **paceline** will form **automatically**.

(4) If the lead holds their power the team will not slow down but keep the tempo. Generally, it is better to lower the duration of turn and a bad idea to lower the power during the turn (especially without adjust everyone else's power).

(5) You'll notice that it is really hard to hold an exact power (except for position 1, maybe). Variations of Â±50W or more are totally normal. Keep at it. You'll figure it out. Think of position 2 and further back power not as "power you have to make" but rather "minimal power you can make" and still stay in the draft. However, that goes out the window if anyone in front of you goes over power. Hence: keep to your prescribed power and make the life for your team mates easy.
